# Simple Rest Poker Table

This is a project to implement a simple poker table with a REST interface
that can be connected to from a client to play rounds of poker against
other clients connected.

I am in the process of developing and testing some poker strategies to
implement and wanted a way to test these strategies against each other.
To do that, I'm creating this as a simple way for multiple poker bots to
connect to a single poker server and play rounds of poker against each other.

This project is NOT intended as a fully featured and secure poker server, 
instead this is intended as a sort of playground to test bots against each 
other. So do not be surprised if you find security issues with this.
